Once upon a time...
In a reality quite like the one you're in right now. 
You were friends with a man named Pedro,
and he was British.
Both of you were in the same Multivariable Calculus class, taught by our sponsor, Mr. Huff.
(you can subscribe to him at RH Mathematics on youtube.com)
Anyway, you and Pedro were both very smart.
But you were smarter.
And to Pedro this was a problem,
You see, Pedro wanted to be valedictorian. 
And you were IN HIS WAY.
So…
With his clever plotting and yellow hoodie,
Pedro decided to use his infinite collection of holy grails to overload a black hole in order to break the space time continuum and send you into another reality.
He succeeded :(
In this new reality, everything is mostly the same.
There are only a few differences, such as…
The C Hall is much prettier…
All non-math teachers at LTHS don’t exist…
And you have to battle the other students in order to get a good grade.
Your goal in this new reality… 
Is to get out of this reality.
And to do that, you need to get through all the mainline math classes taught at LTHS.
Good luck!
